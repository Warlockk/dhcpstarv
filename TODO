Some plans and hopes for dhcpstarv:

- reduce unnecessary header files (and checks)

- it should be (much) faster

- MAC addresses should be more randomized

- too many newer (but low-budget) home routers refuse to play along. Get to the bottom of this!

- the --debug option is very irritating it needs to be either:
        - become part of the overall debug build (see configure --help)
        - become part of the -v --verbose option (showing only "v" is typed twice so dhcpstarv -vv -i eth0 for example)

- (try to) port to Windows

- create deb package(s)

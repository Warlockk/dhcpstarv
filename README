1. WHAT IS DHCPSTARV?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DHCP starvation is attacking a DHCP server by sending a lot of requests to it.
This lead to server's address pool exhausting after which DHCP server is not
able to respond clients and give them new leases.

dhcpstarv is tool that implements DHCP starvation attack. It requests DHCP
leases on specified interface, save them and renew on regular basis.


2. WHAT IS DHCPSTARV FOR?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a rogue DHCP server appear in network with DHCP infrastructure some clients
can get wrong network settings. Those rogue servers can be switched by users by
accident. The only solution to issue is to disconnect such server from network.
But it takes a lot of time to discover rogue server if network is complicated,
i.e. there are many network devices in it. As a temporary solution you can
attack rogue DHCP server until find and disconnect it from network.

Do not use this tool for abuse. This tool was made not for such things. You are
warned.


3. INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Change current directory to where package was unpacked and execute these
commands:

	./configure
	make
	make install

You must login as root to run `make install'. Alternatively you can install to
your own directory:

	./configure --prefix=/path/to/my/dir
	make
	make install

Anyway you must login as root to run dhcpstarv.

For additional options see INSTALL document in source directory.


4. USAGE
~~~~~~~~

To attack DHCP server on interface `eth0' run:

	dhcpstarv -i eth0

If there is a legal DHCP server in network and you don't want to influence it
use `-e' option:

	dhcpstarv -i eth0 -e 192.168.1.1

where 192.168.1.1 is server ID which server put in replies. You can discover it
by running dhcpstarv and interrupt execution by pressing `C-c' (control key and
C) when first lease was reserved (dhcpstarv print information about server from
which options was taken).

You will see when servers shut down: you will not receive addresses more. While
running dhcpstarv will renew leases. If you interrupt DHCP servers will allocate
leases again after some time.

See man page for full list of options.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

DHCP starvation is attacking a DHCP server by sending a lot of requests to it.
This lead to server's address pool exhausting after which DHCP server is not
able to respond clients and give them new leases.

B<dhcpstarv> is tool that implements DHCP starvation attack. It requests DHCP
leases on specified interface, save them and renew on regular basis.

When a rogue DHCP server appear in network with DHCP infrastructure some clients
can get wrong network settings. Those rogue servers can be switched by users by
accident. The only solution to issue is to disconnect such server from network.
But it takes a lot of time to discover rogue server if network is complicated,
i.e. there are many network devices in it. As a temporary solution you can
attack rogue DHCP server until find and disconnect it from network.
